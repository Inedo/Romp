# Romp

This is the repository for Romp, a command-line OtterScript execution engine. Romp is
used to deploy Romp Packages, which are Universal Packages containing additional metadata.

## Installing Romp

If you'd just like to install the latest version of Romp, you can download it from
[here](https://inedo.com/romp/download).

## Building Romp

Romp can be built using Visual Studio 2017 (either the IDE or build tools), but it requires
some NuGet packages that are not generally available from NuGet.org. We are in the process
of making these dependencies available; when we do, we will include instructions here for
how to configure NuGet to be able to access them. Until then, consider this repository
here for reference purposes only.
